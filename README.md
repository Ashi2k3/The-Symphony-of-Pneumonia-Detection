# The-Symphony-of-Pneumonia-Detection
This project tackles the challenge of pneumonia detection using the power of deep learning. We present a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, aptly named the "Symphony of Pneumonia Detection," designed to accurately identify pneumonia in chest X-ray images.
